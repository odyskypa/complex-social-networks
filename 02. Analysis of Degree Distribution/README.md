# CSN Lab 2 - Analysis of the degree distribution
- Before executing the code the `data` folder should have this structure:
    - degree_sequences (folder)
        - Include all the `in-degree .txt` files
    - samples_from_discrete_distributions (folder)
        - Include all the `sample-...txt` files with the artifically generated data
- To execute the software, run the `degree_dist_analysis.R` script.
